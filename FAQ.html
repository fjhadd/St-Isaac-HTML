                <h3 class="card-faq_q">Someone told me that my child must have 2 years of classes before they can get their 1st Communion.  Is this true?</h3>
                <h4 class="card-faq_a">To celebrate Reconciliation and Communion, the church teaches that they must be baptized, reached the age of reason, (usually 7 or older and in 2nd grade or higher.) They should also be formed in their faith before they begin their Sacramental Preparation Classes.  Our parish, along with most others, define this that they have completed at least 1 year of formal Faith Formation either at a Catholic Parish or at a Catholic School.</h4>

                <h3 class="card-faq_q">If my child was supposed to do their 1st Communion or Confirmation this past May, can they still do it this year, or do they have to wait until spring?</h3>
                <h4 class="card-faq_a">The church will be celebrating Confirmation on August 29th and First Holy Communion on September 19th for those who have contacted the Faith Formation Office at faithformation@st-isaac.org at least two weeks ahead of time.</h4>
